  <h3>Information about the Diseases:</h3>

  <div class="row">
    <h4>Diabetes</h4>
    <p>
      Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how your body
      uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is vital to your health because it's
      an important source of energy for the cells that make up your muscles and
      tissues. It's also your brain's main source of fuel. The underlying cause
      of diabetes varies by type. But, no matter what type of diabetes you have,
      it can lead to excess sugar in your blood. Too much sugar in your blood
      can lead to serious health problems.
    </p>
    <h5>Symptoms</h5>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Increased thirst</li>
      <li>Frequent urination</li>
      <li>Extreme hunger</li>
      <li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
      <li>Blurred vision</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <br />
  <div class="row">
    <h4>Heart/ Cardiovascular Disease</h4>
    <p>
      Cardiovascular disease (heart disease) refers to a group of diseases that
      affect the heart and blood vessels of your body. These diseases can affect
      one or many parts of your heart and /or blood vessels. A person may be
      symptomatic (physically experience the disease) or be asymptomatic (not
      feel anything at all).
    </p>
    <h5>Symptoms</h5>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Pounding or racing heart (palpitations)</li>
      <li>Chest pain</li>
      <li>Sweating</li>
      <li>Lightheadedness</li>
      <li>Shortness of breath</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <br />
  <div class="row">
    <h4>Breast Cancer</h4>
    <p>
      Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast. It can start
      in one or both breasts. After skin cancer, breast cancer is the most
      common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. Breast cancer can
      occur in both men and women, but it's far more common in women.
    </p>
    <h5>Symptoms</h5>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>New lump in the breast or underarm (armpit)</li>
      <li>Thickening or swelling of part of the breast.</li>
      <li>Irritation or dimpling of breast skin</li>
      <li>Redness or flaky skin in the nipple area or the breast</li>
      <li>Pulling in of the nipple or pain in the nipple area</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <br />
  <div class="row">
    <h4>Chronic Kidney Disease</h4>
    <p>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means your kidneys are damaged and can’t
      filter blood the way they should. The disease is called “chronic” because
      the damage to your kidneys happens slowly over a long period of time. This
      damage can cause wastes to build up in your body. CKD can also cause other
      health problems.
    </p>
    <h5>Symptoms</h5>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Nausea</li>
      <li>Vomiting</li>
      <li>Fatigue and weakness</li>
      <li>Muscle twitches and cramps</li>
      <li>Loss of appetite</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <br />
  <div class="row">
    <h4>Liver Disease</h4>
    <p>
      The term “liver disease” refers to any of several conditions that can
      affect and damage your liver. Over time, liver disease can cause cirrhosis
      (scarring). As more scar tissue replaces healthy liver tissue, the liver
      can no longer function properly. Left untreated, liver disease can lead to
      liver failure and liver cancer.
    </p>
    <h5>Symptoms</h5>
    <br />
    <ul>
      <li>Abdominal (belly) pain (especially on the right side)</li>
      <li>Bruising easily</li>
      <li>Changes in the color of your urine or stool</li>
      <li>Fatigue</li>
      <li>Nausea or vomiting</li>
    </ul>
